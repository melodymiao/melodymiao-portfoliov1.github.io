      <p id="body">Before I joined the Berkeley Rec Sports team, these were the posts that were made on the social media accounts. While the posts were bright and colorful, the colors did not follow the Rec Sports brand colors or fonts.</p>
      <p id="body">Additionally, posts of the same "type" &#40;such as adaptive sports or hiring posts&#41; did not resemble each other, making them difficult to find among other posts.</p>

I also made the same "type" of posts consistent to one another so that they could be easily distinguished among the other posts on the account.</p>

      <p id="body">When Berkeley Rec Sports decided to rebrand into Berkeley Recreation & Wellbeing, I created a feed divider to distinguish between Rec Sports and RecWell, as well as announce the new brand name.</p>
      <p id="body">To make it obvious that the name was no longer Rec Sports, I began by posting the old Rec Sports logo with its name crossed out. Then, I included the brand's new tagline and finally created a post that announced the rebranding and revealed the new name.</p>
