            <p class="description">MoodTunes is a website where a Spotify playlist is automatically generated 
                to fit the user’s current mood. Users can enter their mood and they will be directed to a curated 
                playlist that they can add to their personal playlists. </p>

        <div  class="text-container">
            <p class="description">Users can select one of five moods: somber, melancholy, neutral, happy, and 
                euphoric. After selecting a mood, the user is instructed to log into Spotify. A playlist will 
                then be generated according to the selected mood using the user’s most-listened songs and artists. </p>

            <h2 class="section-title">How it Works</h2>
            <p class="description">Utilizing a Spotify API that takes the user’s most-listened songs and artists, 
                the songs are ranked on their valence, or their “positivity.” Higher valence songs are given a 
                score closer to 1.0 while lower valence songs are given a score closer to 0.0. The five mood 
                inputs correspond to valence scores of 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9 respectively. </p>
            <p class="description">Then, a playlist is created with songs corresponding to the selected mood 
                and songs along with several recommended tracks. The user will then be able to save the generated playlist 
                to their Spotify library.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">The Design</h2>
            <p class="description">For the interface, I decided to create a minimalist and bold design with bright 
                colors. I created different faces with organic shapes to create a fun, playful design. The faces also 
                provide a visual representation of the different mood levels. I also utilized these faces in the MoodTunes 
                logo to integrate the logo into a memorable brand identity. </p>
